📊 The Science Behind Speed Reading
SpeedRead Pro is based on Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP), a technique that displays text one word at a time in a fixed position. This method:

Eliminates subvocalization (mentally pronouncing words)
Reduces eye movement fatigue from scanning text
Focuses attention on each word individually
Can increase reading speeds by 2-3x with practice

Studies have shown that with practice, RSVP can help readers achieve speeds of 400-700 WPM while maintaining good comprehension (compared to average reading speeds of 200-300 WPM for traditional reading).
