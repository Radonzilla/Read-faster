## 📊 The Science Behind Speed Reading
SpeedRead Pro is based on **Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP)**, a technique that displays text one word at a time in a fixed position. This method:
- Eliminates subvocalization (mentally pronouncing words)
- Reduces eye movement fatigue from scanning text
- Focuses attention on each word individually
- Can increase reading speeds by 2-3x with practice

Studies have shown that with practice, RSVP can help readers achieve speeds of **400-700 WPM** while maintaining good comprehension (compared to average reading speeds of **200-300 WPM** for traditional reading).

## 🔧 Technical Details
SpeedRead Pro is built with:
- **Vanilla JavaScript** – No frameworks, keeping it lightweight
- **PDF.js** – For PDF text extraction
- **JSZip** – For EPUB parsing
- **CSS animations** – For smooth transitions and modern UI elements
- **LocalStorage API** – For saving user preferences
